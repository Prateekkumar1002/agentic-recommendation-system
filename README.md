# agentic-recommendation-system
An end-to-end production-grade recommendation system with autonomous self-improving AI agents.

This project demonstrates how modern classical ML, deep learning, LLMs, and agentic AI systems can be combined to build a self-optimizing personalization engine for content feeds such as lock-screen media, news, or short-form entertainment platforms.

Why this project?
Most recommendation systems stop at prediction.

This system goes further:
It observes itself, evaluates itself, and improves itself automatically using agentic AI.

This mirrors how next-generation platforms are evolving — from static models to self-improving AI systems.
